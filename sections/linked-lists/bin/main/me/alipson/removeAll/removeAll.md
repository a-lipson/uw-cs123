Remove All [Complex Programming Problem]

Problem Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Write a method removeAll() that removes all occurrences of a given value and
returns the number of occurrences of the given value that were removed.

  For instance, if a variable list contained the following values:

    list = [2, -4, 12, 0, 2, 2]

  then after calling list.removeAll(2), list would return 3 and contain the
  following values:

    list = [-4, 12, 0]

The method must preserve the original ordering of elements in the list. If the
list is empty, or the list contains no occurrences of the given value, the list
should not be changed.

Step 1 - Pseudocode
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Write pseudocode that will enable us to perform the expected behavior above.

Step 2 - Implementation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once you write pseudocode for this problem, implement the code using Java syntax.

Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - You should not create any additional data structures.
  - Assume you are adding this method to the LinkedIntList class.
